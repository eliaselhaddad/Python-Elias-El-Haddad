# Python-Elias-El-Haddad

I was introduced to programming about 15 years ago, when I took an elective course in Java. Back then I was majoring in Graphic Design and programming was not trending as it is nowadays. Although I finished the course and it was somewhat interesting, I didn't follow through, as it didn't have a direct relation to the my major.

During the pandemic as my business was suffering, I started looking for a career change. And software development just made sence, as it one can easily work from home and the market was screaming for new competence. So I enrolled in a couple of courses in Java and Python, and that was surprisingly enough to light the fire in me to pursue a career as a softwar developer.

Moving forward, in the summer of 2022, I got accepted at "IT-Högskola" as a "Developer in AI and machine learning". And I'm looking forward to keep learning everyday, in order to achieve my goal.
