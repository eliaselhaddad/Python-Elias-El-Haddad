# Python-Elias-El-Haddad
I was introduced to programming about 15 years ago, when I took an elective course in Java. Back then I was majoring in Graphic Design and programming was not trending as it is nowadays. Although I finished the course and it was somewhat interesting, I didn't follow through, as it didn't have a direct relation to the my major.
